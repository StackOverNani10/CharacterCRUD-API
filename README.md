    "content": {
        "screenMessage": "Message of screen",
        "actions": [
            {
                "name": "Screen name",
                "button": "Button name",
                "screenName": "Next screen name"
            },
            {
                "name": "Another Screen name",
                "button": "Another Button name",
                "screenName": "Another Next screen name"

- It is important that each screen has a name so that it can be called from another screen.

- The screen type must be defined according to the following options "info" or "crud".

- Within the content of the screen we have the option to insert a message which will be displayed when the screen is displayed, this field is optional.

- The "actions" field contains all the possible alternatives that the user will have, each of these has a "name" field of the required type, a "button" field which contains the name that executes the action and finally a "screenName" field. where the name of the screen to be redirected to is placed.
